In JavaScript, Local Storage is a built-in Web Storage API that allows 
you to store key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. 
Itâ€™s commonly used to store user preferences, theme settings, and other 
small pieces of data that need to persist across browser sessions.

Key Features
Stores data in key/value pairs.
Stored data persists even after the browser is closed.
Maximum size: around 5MB per origin.
Only accessible by scripts from the same origin (domain + protocol + port).


Syntax

Save data
localStorage.setItem("username", "Abhinav");

Retrieve data
const user = localStorage.getItem("username");
console.log(user); // Abhinav


Remove a specific item
localStorage.removeItem("username");


Remove all items
localStorage.clear();


Check how many items are stored
console.log(localStorage.length);


Get the key by index
console.log(localStorage.key(0));
